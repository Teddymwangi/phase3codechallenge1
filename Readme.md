# Challenges

This repository contains solutions to coding challenges. Below are the descriptions and solutions to each challenge.

## Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

### Description
The task is to create a function that converts a 12-hour time to a 24-hour time format.

### Function Signature
```python
def convert_to_24_hour(hour, minute, period):
    # Implementation goes here
    pass
## Challenge 2: Return true if two numbers are positive

### Description
The task is to create  a function that when you input 3 numbers it should return true if two of the numbers are positive numbers(even numbers)

## challenge 3: consonant value

This challenge involves finding the highest value among consonant substrings in a lowercase string.

## Problem Description

Given a lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters and no spaces, the task is to return the highest value among consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". Each consonant is assigned a numerical value: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.

### Examples

For the word "zodiacs":
- Input: "zodiacs"
- Output: 26
- Explanation: After removing vowels, the consonant substrings are "z", "d", and "cs". Their values are z = 26, d = 4, and cs = 3 + 19 = 22. The highest value is 26.

For the word "strength":
- Input: "strength"
- Output: 57
- Explanation: The consonant substrings are "str" and "ngth" with values "str" = 19 + 20 + 18 = 57 and "ngth" = 14 + 7 + 20 + 8 = 49. The highest value is 57.

## Function Signature

```python
def solve(word):
    # Implementation goes here
    pass
